## [1.0.0] - 2018-06-02
### Added
- A pointer to a HardwareSerial object inside the IMU object for debugging purposes.
- setSerial() method to pass the Serial instance pointer to the IMU object.
- init() method to perform initialization tasks (i.e. self-test, calibration, initialization).
- update() method to update the output values if new sensor data is available.
- MPU9250_RESET() macro defined function to reset the chip.
- Enumerations for digital low pass (DLPF) registers for both accelerometer and gyro.
- Debugging blocks inside the library which can be enabled by defining DEBUG macro.

### Changed
- Calibration now requires a macro defined flag (one for each gyro and accel) to update the bias values to the bias registers. It still writes the bias values to the input array.
- selfTest() method now returns true if self-test is passed. It also doesn't return the results. (But can show them if DEBUG is true.)
- The name of AFS and GFS enumerators are changed to avoid confusion.
- Minor changes in register initialization of IMU.
